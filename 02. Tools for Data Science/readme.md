## Summary
        
   　This module provides an overview of commonly used programming languages such as Python, R, Scala, and SQL, and the open source and commercial tools available to Data Scientists. It also covers the use of APIs, datasets, and models frequently used in data science, as well as machine learning, deep learning, and their use cases. Additionally, the module introduces three popular tools in data science, including GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, and RStudio IDE. Learners will also be introduced to IBM's enterprise-ready data science platform, Watson Studio, and its features and capabilities, as well as other IBM tools used to support data science projects. Finally, learners will demonstrate their skills by creating and configuring a Jupyter Notebook and sharing it for peer review.
