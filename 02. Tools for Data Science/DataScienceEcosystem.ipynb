    "## Instructions\n",
    "Note - Screenshots\n",
    "Throughout this lab, you will be prompted to take screenshots and save them on your device. You will need these screenshots to upload them as your submission for peer review at the end of this course. You can use various free screengrabbing tools or your operating system's shortcut keys to do this (for example, Alt+PrintScreen in Windows and Shift+Command+3 for Mac).\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Exercise 1: Create a Jupyter Notebook</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new Jupyter notebook called DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The next item in the course will launch JupyterLite with an empty notebook with this name that you can use to complete rest of the Exercises. You can also use any other Jupyter notebook environment (e.g. Anaconda) that you prefer to complete the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Exercise 2: Create markdown cell with title of the notebook</strong>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Exercise 3 - Create a markdown cell for an introduction</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an introductory sentence about the notebook such as the follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Exercise 10 - Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell start with an introductory line titled: Objectives: in bold font. Then using an unordered list (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook, such as List popular languages for Data Science.\n",
    "Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 10-objectives.png (Images can be saved with either the .jpg or .png extension.)\n",
