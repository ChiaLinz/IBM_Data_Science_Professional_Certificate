## Summary
 ã€€This Python course is divided into four modules, each focusing on different aspects of the programming language. The first module is a comprehensive introduction to Python that covers data types, mathematical operations, variables, and string manipulation. The second module introduces Python data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, and teaches operations that can be performed on them. The third module delves into more advanced topics such as conditions, branching, loops, functions, exception handling, objects, and classes in Python. Finally, the fourth module focuses on working with data in Python, including reading and writing files, using libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data analysis, and collecting data through APIs and webscraping. By the end of this course, students will have a strong understanding of Python fundamentals and be equipped with the skills needed to tackle more complex programming challenges.
