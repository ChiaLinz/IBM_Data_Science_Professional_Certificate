## Summary
 ã€€In these modules, you will learn about the data science methodology and its six key stages, namely Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. You will also learn how to apply the methodology to a case study and how to handle missing, invalid, or misleading data, build a decision tree model, and evaluate its performance using a training and test dataset. Furthermore, you will learn about the importance of model feedback and how to elicit it from stakeholders, refine a model based on feedback, and assess its performance and impact. Finally, you will demonstrate your understanding of the methodology by applying it to a self-defined business problem related to email, hospitals, or credit cards and peer-reviewing your peers' final projects using a rubric.

##  Main Topics 

  ### [Module 1: From Problem to Approach](https://github.com/ChiaLinz/IBM_Data_Science_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/03.%20%20Data%20Science%20Methodology/01.%20From-Problem-to-Approach.ipynb)
  1. Business Understanding
      * The need to understand and prioritize the business goal.
      * The way stakeholder support influences a project. 
   2.  Analytic Approach
       *	The importance of selecting the right model.
       *	When to use a predictive, descriptive, or classification model. 

   ### [Module 2: From Requirements to Collection](https://github.com/ChiaLinz/IBM_Data_Science_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/03.%20%20Data%20Science%20Methodology/02.%20From-Requirements-to-Collection.ipynb)
   3. Data Requirements
       *	The significance of defining the data requirements for your model.
       *	Why the content, format, and representation of your data matter. 
   4. Data Collection
       *	The importance of identifying the correct sources of data for your project.
       *	How to handle unavailable and redundant data.
       *	To anticipate the needs of future stages in the process.


   ### [Module 3: From Understanding to Preparation and from Modeling to Evaluation](https://github.com/ChiaLinz/IBM_Data_Science_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/03.%20%20Data%20Science%20Methodology/03.%20From-Understanding-to-Preparation.ipynb)
   5. Data Understanding
       *	The importance of descriptive statistics.
   6. Data Preparation
       *	How to manage missing, invalid, or misleading data.
       *	The need to clean data and sometimes transform it.
       *	The consequences of bad data for the model.
       *	Data understanding is iterative; you learn more about your data the more you study it. 
   7. Modeling
       *	The difference between descriptive and predictive models.
       *	The role of training sets and test sets.
       *	The importance of asking if the question has been answered.
   8. Evaluation
       *	Why diagnostic measures tools are needed.
       *	The purpose of statistical significance tests.
       * That modeling and evaluation are iterative processes.

   ### [Module 4: From Deployment to Feedback](https://github.com/ChiaLinz/IBM_Data_Science_Professional_Certificate/blob/main/03.%20%20Data%20Science%20Methodology/04.%20From-Modeling-to-Evaluation.ipynb)
   9. Deployment
       *	The importance of stakeholder input.
       *	To consider the scale of deployment.
   10. Feedback
       *	The importance of incorporating feedback to refine the model.
       *	The refined model must be redeployed.
       *	This process should be repeated as often as necessary.
