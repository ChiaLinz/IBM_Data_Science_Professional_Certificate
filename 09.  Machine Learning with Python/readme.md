## Summary
 　This module covers different applications of Machine Learning in various fields such as healthcare, banking, and telecommunication. The course provides a general overview of Machine Learning topics, including supervised vs. unsupervised learning, various techniques used in Machine Learning, and the advantages of using Python libraries for implementing Machine Learning models.

 　It also covers regression techniques such as Linear, Non-linear, Simple, and Multiple regression, and their applications. Students learn how to evaluate their regression model and calculate its accuracy.

 　Next, it focuses on classification techniques such as KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM. Students practice with different classification algorithms, learn their pros and cons, and explore different classification accuracy metrics.

 　In addition, it covers clustering, specifically k-means clustering, and how to use it for customer segmentation. Students will also work on a project based on what they have learned, building and training different regression and classification models, creating final classification reports, and evaluating their peers' projects.

 　Overall, students will gain an understanding of the basics of Machine Learning, how to apply various Machine Learning algorithms, and how to evaluate and improve their models.
